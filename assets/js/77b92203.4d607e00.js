Deployment cannot generate fix IDs and thus is not appropriate for StatefulSet features. Whereas, StatefulSet cannot perform management on specified game servers flexibly.

For example, for game servers, a rolling update mechanism is required to ensure a shorter game interruption, and in-place updates are required to ensure that the network-based metadata information remains unchanged. A mechanism to ensure logouts occur only in zero-player game servers during auto scaling and the capability to allow to manually perform O&M, diagnosis, and isolation on game servers are required.
