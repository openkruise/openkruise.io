Due to the short time of a single game, the service logic of the room is often not changed after the game is started. Instead, the newly opened service logic is opened after the one-click update is released. The rooms use the latest version, and the existing room servers do not make any changes; at the same time, the matching system is used to import new players into the new version of the room; and the automatic scaling mechanism is used to make the number of rooms in the old version continue to decrease as the number of people is lost. The number of rooms in the new version continues to increase as the number of people increases, and the version switch is finally completed.\nThe entire process only requires changing the room server container image, which is automatically updated without stopping the server, greatly reducing the complexity of operation and maintenance."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"existing-game-rooms-will-not-be-updated",children:"Existing game rooms will not be updated"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'When using the GameServerSet workload, you can select the "OnDelete" update type to achieve the effect of not updating the existing room server, but using the new version for the new room server.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"For example, if you initially deploy a GameServerSet with 3 replicas, the image tags are all 1.12.2"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{className:"language-yaml",children:"apiVersion: game.kruise.io/v1alpha1\nkind: GameServerSet\nmetadata:\n  name: minecraft\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  updateStrategy:\n    type: OnDelete\n  gameServerTemplate:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2\n          name: minecraft\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"At this time, the image is updated and the image tag is changed to 1.12.2-new"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{className:"language-bash",children:"kubectl edit gss minecraft\n\n...\nspec:\n  gameServerTemplate:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2-new\n        name: minecraft\n...\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It can be seen that the existing GameServers has not been updated, and the image tag is still 1.12.2"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{className:"language-bash",children:"kubectl get po -oyaml | grep minecraft-demo\n    - image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2\n      image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2\n      imageID: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo@sha256:8aa4177a19b15d7336162c6ca4d833a74c3cb23d85eab2ef2a63f7a2a682b8fb\n    - image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2\n      image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2\n      imageID: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo@sha256:8aa4177a19b15d7336162c6ca4d833a74c3cb23d85eab2ef2a63f7a2a682b8fb\n    - image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2\n      image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2\n      imageID: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo@sha256:8aa4177a19b15d7336162c6ca4d833a74c3cb23d85eab2ef2a63f7a2a682b8fb\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"At this time, scale GameServerSet and create a new game server minecraft-3, and find that its image tag is 1.12.2-new"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{className:"language-bash",children:"kubectl scale gss minecraft --replicas=4\ngameserverset.game.kruise.io/minecraft scaled\n\n\nkubectl get po minecraft-3 -oyaml | grep minecraft-demo\n  - image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2-new\n    image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2-new\n    imageID: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo@sha256:f68fd7d5e6133c511b374a38f7dbc35acedce1d177dd78fba1d62d6264d5cba0\n"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"linkage-with-matching-system",children:"Linkage with matching system"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"When a new version of the image exists in the GameServerSet, the matching system needs to decide which version of the room server the player will enter."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There are two ways for the matching system to sense the version under the current workload:"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.ol,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.li,{children:"When the room server is started, its own version will be automatically registered and reported, and it will be de-registered and destructed when deleted."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.li,{children:"When matching, the matching system calls the Kubernetes API to query the version currently suitable for the player."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"These two methods are similar to the method of obtaining the room server address mentioned above, and they can be implemented in the same way.\nIf you press method 1, when the room server is started, the access address information will be reported together with the version information; if you press method 2, additional logic will be added to filter the room server version when searching for a suitable room server."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It should be noted that even if the matching system detects the latest version, it does not allow players to enter only the latest version at this time.
