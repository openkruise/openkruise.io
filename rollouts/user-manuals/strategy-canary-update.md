### Behavior Explanation
When you apply a new revision for `workload-demo`:
- The workload `workload-demo` will be paused, and no Pod is updated;
- A new canary Deployment will be created, and its replicas is "20%" of `workload-demo` (There will be `120%` Pods totally);
- `20%` traffic will be guided to the new canary Deployment Pods.

When you thought the verification of canary is ok, and confirmed to next step:
- The workload `workload-demo` will be upgraded using native rolling update strategy;
- The traffic will be restored to native load balance strategy;
- The canary Deployment and Pods will be deleted.
