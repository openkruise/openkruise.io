    - **Note**: Ensure that the project label key defined here matches the label key used when deploying GameServerSets. The project name in the GameServerSet YAML file should align with the configuration in the Global Configuration to ensure proper organization and functionality.

    **Example YAML for GameServerSet**:

      ```yaml
        apiVersion: game.kruise.io/v1alpha1
        kind: GameServerSet
        metadata:
          labels:
            # The GameServerSets that have this label can be recognized by the Dashboard.
            project-name: project-new
          name: game-new
          namespace: default
        spec:
          replicas: 5
          updateStrategy:
            rollingUpdate:
              podUpdatePolicy: InPlaceIfPossible
          gameServerTemplate:
            reclaimPolicy: Delete
            metadata:
              labels:
                # The GameServers that have this label can be recognized by the Dashboard.
                project-name: project-new
            spec:
              containers:
                - image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2
                  name: minecraft
