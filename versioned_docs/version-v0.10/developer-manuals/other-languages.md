title: Other languages
---

Currently, Kruise has not supported SDK for languages other than Golang and Java.
Actually we only recommend you to use [Golang Client](./go-client), which is guaranteed to be latest and stable.

If you are using other languages such as Python, you have to use their officail K8s client such as [kubernetes-client/python](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python).
Usually they all have provided methods to let you operate any custom resources.
